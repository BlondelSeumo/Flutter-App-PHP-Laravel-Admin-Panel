# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/cfg/
    - assets/img/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
  - family: Poppins
    fonts:
      - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Thin.ttf
        weight: 100
      - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-ExtraLight.ttf
        weight: 200
      - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Light.ttf
        weight: 300
      - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Regular.ttf
        weight: 400
      - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Medium.ttf
        weight: 500
      - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-SemiBold.ttf
